Yasm Mailing Lists
==================

Yasm has a number of mailing lists dedicated to development discussions and notices.  Use [Mailman](http://cvs.tortall.net/mailman/listinfo/) to subscribe or view mailing list archives.

There are currently three main mailing lists for Yasm:

yasm-announce
-------------

The [yasm-announce](http://cvs.tortall.net/mailman/listinfo/yasm-announce) mailing list is a low-traffic list only used for sending out major Yasm announcements, such as for new releases.

 * [yasm-announce archives](http://cvs.tortall.net/pipermail/yasm-announce/)

yasm-cvs
--------

The [yasm-cvs](http://cvs.tortall.net/mailman/listinfo/yasm-cvs) mailing list records every commit made to the Yasm [Git repository](http://github.com/yasm/yasm/).  High traffic, but perhaps interesting for those following Yasm development.

 * [yasm-cvs archives](http://cvs.tortall.net/pipermail/yasm-cvs/)

yasm-devel
----------

The [yasm-devel](http://cvs.tortall.net/mailman/listinfo/yasm-devel) mailing list is intended for general discussions of Yasm development.  It's primarily a technical mailing list for those actively working on Yasm, or those interested in Yasm development.

 * [yasm-devel archives](http://cvs.tortall.net/pipermail/yasm-devel/)
